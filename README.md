## :angry: Hack not working?!
Be sure the links to be the same as above! (look carefully if the links are the same!)

The cheat is updating regularly so you need to change values too...

And don't forget to press ctrl + f5 when going to surviv.io website

## :rage: Hack Freezing?!
Surviv.io has an anti-cheat system that sometimes makes the game freeze (stop), so I need time to investigate this and fix.

## :ice_cream: Clean Code file
You can get the clean code - check "app.50d15b72_clean_code.js" file and you can use this file to:
* Modify hack settings
* Add additional features
* Fix bugs and do code improvement or optimisation

(Only if you know js programming language)

## History:
Hack was freezing because of surviv.io DEVS with their inti-cheat system

I abandoned and now I try to revive the hack.
